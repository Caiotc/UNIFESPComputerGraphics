# Introduction

##

## Hello my fellow code companion!

This repository was created to document my learning of computer graphics. I'm actually covering my university class assignments and personal experiments with openGl and glut(Graphical Library Utility kit).

# About The repo

- I have maded a basic structure on this repo where you can find my assigments on the assigment folder. Every assigment has a make file to make the compilation process a bit easier(I use gcc).

- on the Exploration folder you will find tiny projects that do very litle. They are experimentations on functionalies that I dont understand quite well,yet.
- On the mainLibrary folder you will find my data Structures implementations and my utilities to genrate graphics and deal with geometry. I'm really trying to improve my programming abilities and, in especific my C skill - so, experienced c coder please reach me if you see a better way to aproach anything.

- On the project section of this repo u will see my kanban table, where u will find everything I alredy did, what I am doing and what I will do.
